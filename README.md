This is the readme for the personal project for cmpe 202 sjsu , msse spring 2017.
The idea is to create a uml parser which will take in the java code and outputs the uml diagrams for it.


We will be using Maven project in eclipse so that we can get the maven dependencies.
For uml diagrams we wil be using plantuml, and the idea is to extract the notation from the files , put it in a text and then call plantuml method on it to generate the diagrams. We need an external software for the dot.exe for generating diagrams other than sequence diagrams in plantuml.
