issues faced till day:
1. maven in eclipse
2. graphviz and dot
3. plantuml maven
4. get objects
5. how to retrieve signatures?
6. Create uses relationship: find if a class is dependent on the object of some oter class by the virtue of being parameter to one of ots functions
7. getters and setters
8. multilplicity - get one to many , one to one etc relationship between two classes, if one class uses single object of other class it is one-one, if more than one to many, similarly  bidirectional.
